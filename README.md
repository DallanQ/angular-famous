An alternate approach to integrating Famo.us and AngularJS.
This approach requires you to write a bit more code than famous-angular, but the library is simpler.

To test the examples
* run `bower install`
* start a webserver (e.g., `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000`)
* point your browser to `examples/index.html`
